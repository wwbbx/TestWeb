TestWeb is the folder that contains all BDD test cases running by cucumber for
many available web application solutions.

It is reference webdriver-js-example project on GitHub.

1. Install cucumber globally (npm install -g cucumber)
2. Start selenium server standalone using "java -jar selenium-server-standaline.jar"
3. Make sure ChromeDriver or other explorer driver can be found in PATH. I used C:\TOOLS

Run it using "cucumber-js AiR"
